# 🧮 NumPy Mini Projects

This repository contains two beginner-friendly NumPy mini projects designed to strengthen your fundamental understanding of array operations, reshaping, slicing, and real-world data manipulation using NumPy.

## 📌 Projects Included

### ✅ 1. Student Marks Analyzer

Analyze and process the performance of students using randomly generated marks data.

#### 🔍 Key Concepts Used:
- 2D array creation using `np.random.randint`
- Axis-based aggregation using `np.mean`, `np.sum`, `np.argmax`
- Boolean masking (e.g., students scoring above 80 in all subjects)
- Reshaping and flattening arrays (`reshape`, `flatten`, `ravel`)

#### 📊 Features:
- Calculate average marks per student
- Identify top scorers in each subject
- Filter high-achieving students
- Reshape data for model-style input

### ✅ 2. Sales Tracker for a Store

Simulates weekly sales data for products and performs business analysis.

#### 🔍 Key Concepts Used:
- Matrix operations and summarization (`sum`, `mean`, `argmax`)
- Weekly and product-wise analysis
- `hstack`, `vstack` for adding bonus columns and summary rows
- Reshaping data for ML or reporting formats (`reshape(1, -1)`, `flatten`)

#### 📊 Features:
- Calculate weekly and product-level sales totals and averages
- Identify best/worst performing weeks and products
- Add special event sales using `hstack`
- Prepare data for ML pipelines by reshaping

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/numpy-mini-projects.git
cd numpy-mini-projects
Run any project using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python student_marks_analyzer.py
# or
python sales_tracker.py
📚 Learning Outcome
These projects helped me build a strong foundation in:

Data structuring with NumPy

Real-world-style problem solving

Clean, modular Python code for analysis

💡 Next Steps
Expand to Pandas + Matplotlib for visualization

Use NumPy in larger data science pipelines

Add more projects (image filtering, sudoku matrix checker, etc.)
